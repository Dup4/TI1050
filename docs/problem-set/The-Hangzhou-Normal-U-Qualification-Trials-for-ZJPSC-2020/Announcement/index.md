The problem were created by [Dup4](https://codeforces.com/profile/Dup4),[Hsueh-](https://codeforces.com/profile/2017212212083) and [lts](https://codeforces.com/profile/lts).

Thanks to [MikeMirzayanov](https://codeforces.com/profile/MikeMirzayanov) for the Codeforces and Polygon platforms.

We tried to make interesting problems, short statements, useful samples and strong datatests, and we hope you will like it.

The domain name of the contest page is [hznu.cc](https://hznu.cc).

To prevent accidents, we have prepared $3$ additional alternate domain names:

* [t1.dup4.top](https://t1.dup4.top)
* [t2.dup4.top](https://t2.dup4.top)
* [t3.dup4.top](https://t3.dup4.top)

Behind these four domain names are four different links to the Codeforces server in Russia, which may have different effects in different network environments.

In theory,[hznu.cc](https://hznu.cc) is the fastest. But when it can't get in, we recommend you to try an alternate domain name, it may be useful.

In order for everyone to adapt to the competition platform in advance, we have prepared a warm-up contest.

The warm-up contest will take place on [***Thursday, September 10, 2020 at 12:00***](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20200910T12\&p1=501), and the duration is ***$5$ days***.

* You can experience the ***code printing function*** and ***Clarifications***.
